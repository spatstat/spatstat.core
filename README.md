# spatstat.core

This is a subset of the original `spatstat` package.

The original `spatstat` package is still available
at its [CRAN page](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/spatstat)
or at [the GitHub repository](https://github.com/spatstat/spatstat).

The original `spatstat` package is currently being split into
several sub-packages.

This package `spatstat.core` is one of the
sub-packages. It contains all the main user-level functions that perform
statistical analysis and modelling of spatial data,
with the exception of data on linear networks.

The reorganisation of the `spatstat` family is described
on the GitHub repository
[baddstats/spatstat](https://github.com/baddstats/spatstat).
