## Statistical analysis and modelling of spatial data for the spatstat family

[![CRAN_Status_Badge](http://www.r-pkg.org/badges/version/spatstat.core)](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/spatstat.core) 
[![GitHub R package version](https://img.shields.io/github/r-package/v/spatstat/spatstat.core)](https://github.com/spatstat/spatstat.core)

The original `spatstat` package has been split into
several sub-packages (See [spatstat/spatstat](https://github.com/spatstat/spatstat))

This package `spatstat.core` is one of the
sub-packages. It contains all the main user-level functions that perform
statistical analysis and modelling of spatial data,
with the exception of data on linear networks.

Most of the functionality is for spatial point patterns in two dimensions.
There is a very modest amount of functionality for 3D and higher dimensional patterns
and space-time patterns.

### Overview 

`spatstat.core` supports

- exploratory analysis (quadrat counting test, kernel smoothing, K-function, pair correlation function)
- nonparametric estimation (resource selection function, prospectivity)
- parametric modelling (fitting models to point pattern data, model selection, model prediction)
- formal inference (hypothesis tests, confidence intervals)
- informal validation (model diagnostics)


### Detailed contents

For a full list of functions, see the help file for `spatstat.core-package`.
